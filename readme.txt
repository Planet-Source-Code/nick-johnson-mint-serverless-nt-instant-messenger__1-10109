Mint 1.03.27, Copyright 2000, Nick Johnson (arachnid@mad.scientist.com)

Mint is an instant messenger for Windows NT (Only tested in NT 4).
Mint makes extensive use of the NT APIs (Application programming
interfaces) to allow online and offline notification of selected users,
ignore and quiet features, and the capibility to easily send and
recieve pop-up messages from other mint users or anyone who can send
Windows NT pop-up messages.
Mint can be used to monitor the online/offline activity of users, and
send them pop-up messages, even if that user is not running Mint
themselves. However, if they are not running Mint, they will not be
able to reply.

Acceptable use license:
Mint is released in both executable and VB source-code form. You may
freely use Mint for personal and non-profit use, and modify the source
code to suit you. However, corporate or non-profit users must apply
for a company license (I am a student, and I need to earn something!)
To apply for a company licence, email me at arachnid@mad.scientist.com
with details of the type of company and the number of computers it is
likely to be used on, and I will respond with a licensing fee.
Licensing fees are likely to be around $15US per computer, and less for
large numbers of computers, but this is not definite.

While you are free to modify Mint source code for your personal use,
you may NOT distribute the modified source in any form. To redistribute,
this package MUST be intact. If you have an improvement you think is
useful to others, please email it to me at the above address and I will
consider including it into future versions.

Enjoy, and please feel free to send me any comments/complaints
